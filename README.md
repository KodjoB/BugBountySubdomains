# BugBountySubdomains

Simple scripts to enumerate bug bounty programs and subdomains. Useful for information gathering and hunting. 

Use the information to gather more subdomains, check for subdomain takeovers, delegation, etc. 

# Some Usage Ideas:

python geth1programs.py > h1programs.txt

python geth1urls.py <programname>

Get subdomains from one program.
python geth1urls.py spotify

Get URLs from all programs

./program.sh


# TODO

Scrape BugCrowd program and subdomains

# DISCLAIMER

I hold no responsibility for how you use the gathered resources.

May break at any time.

Always follow HackerOne rules and program specific rules.
Always verify the enumerated programs and URLs are in-scope before bug hunting.
